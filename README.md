# mission_to_mars
In this assignment, I have built a web page that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displayed the information in a single HTML page. 

1. The actual scraping is done in "mission_to_mars.ipynb" file, 
2. from which the function 'scrape()' is written in scrape_mars.py.
3. 'app.py' is created to handle mongodb & flask functionality
4. 'index.html' contains the layout of the content that will be displayed once the server starts running.
5. You can view the screenshots of the actual web page under ./screenshots/ folder
